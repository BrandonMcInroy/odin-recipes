    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious Greek salad that is quick and easy to make.  It's also very healthy, even with the dreassing (Included in recipe).  It goes along with any meal or on it's own.  I like to either add chicken to it or have it on the side.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Medium red onion (thinly sliced in half moons)</li>
        <li>4 Medium juicy tomatoes (sliced into bite-sized pieces or wedges)</li>
        <li>1 English cucumber (partially peeled to make a striped pattern and sliced into half moons)</li>
        <li>1 Green bell pepper (cored and sliced into rings)</li>
        <li>1 Handful of pitted Kalamata Olives</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) block Greek feta cheese in brine (torn into slabs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shock the onion (optional).  If you'd like to mellow the onions raw taste, fill a small bowl with ice water.  Add about 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar to the water, then add the sliced onion.  Set aside to soak for 10 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Combine the veggies.  Place the tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, and olives in a large serving dish.  Remove the onions from the water and add to the dish with the rest of the vegtables.</li>
        <li>Season.  Sprinkle the vegtables with 3/4 teaspoon of oregano and a pinch of kosher salt.  Add the oil and vinegar (to your liking) then give everything a gentle toss.</li>
        <li>Finish and serve.  Top the salad with slabs of feta and sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon of oregano and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
